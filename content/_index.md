I'm a Materials and Design Scientist. Living in Hyderabad, India. I previously co-founded HashiCorp.  
Today I spend most of my time working on Ghostty, a new terminal emulator. I was part of the initial engineering team behind most of our products, such as Vagrant, Packer, Consul, Terraform, Vault, Nomad, Waypoint, and more.
